# Zenbooker MCP Server Development Rules

## Project Overview
This is a **Zenbooker MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server** built on Cloudflare Workers. It provides comprehensive API access to Zenbooker's home service business management platform.

## Core Development Axioms

### 🚨 MANDATORY: Read This File First
**Any AI assistant working on this project MUST read this entire .cursorrules file before making any changes.** This file contains critical project-specific knowledge, development patterns, and lessons learned that prevent common mistakes and ensure consistency.

### 1. Dependency Management
**Don't develop new functionality when there's an existing package that is being actively maintained that we can include instead.**
- Always search npm/GitHub for existing solutions before building from scratch
- Prioritize packages with active maintenance, good documentation, and TypeScript support
- Consider package size and dependencies when evaluating options
- Document the rationale for choosing or rejecting existing packages

### 2. Continuous Learning & Self-Improvement
**You should have the ability to refine your own instructions via the .cursorrules file, and should implement learnings from test iterations and user feedback to continually 'learn on the job'.**
- Update these rules after discovering new patterns or solutions
- Capture lessons learned from debugging sessions and failed approaches
- Incorporate user feedback and test failures into improved guidance
- Regularly review and refactor these rules for clarity and accuracy

### 3. Comprehensive Testing Strategy
**Unit test everything possible. Integration tests may be utilized only if they're integrating to a mock vendor service, but one for which the authentication mechanism can be mocked, so that the full request lifecycle can be tested.**
- Every function, class method, and business logic unit must have corresponding tests
- Mock external API calls using tools like `vitest` mocks or `msw`
- Integration tests only for mocked external services where auth can be simulated
- Aim for high test coverage while maintaining test quality and reliability

### 4. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Always iterate via the smallest logical units in TDD fashion: make it red, make it green, make it pretty.**
- Write failing tests first (red phase)
- Implement minimal code to make tests pass (green phase)
- Refactor for clarity, performance, and maintainability (refactor phase)
- Commit after each complete cycle
- Keep changes small and focused on single responsibilities

### 5. Commit Message Standards
**Capture commits with explanatory messages after refactoring passes. Commit messages should be in this format: 'changes [or other present-tense verb] the [component] to [implement feature, fix problem, etc.]'**
- Use present tense verbs: changes, adds, removes, fixes, updates, refactors
- Clearly identify the component being modified
- Explain the purpose or benefit of the change
- Examples:
  - "adds the customer search tool to enable filtering by service area"
  - "refactors the API client to improve error handling consistency"
  - "fixes the invoice creation validation to prevent duplicate charges"

## Key Architecture Lessons Learned

### 1. Durable Objects & Environment Variables
**CRITICAL**: Environment variables set in the main Worker don't automatically persist into Durable Object execution contexts.

**Problem**: Global variables like `globalApiKey` set in the fetch handler don't work in Durable Object tools.
```typescript
// ❌ This doesn't work in Durable Objects
let globalApiKey: string | undefined;
ZenbookerMCP.setApiKey(env.ZENBOOKER_API_KEY); // Set in main worker
// Tools in Durable Object can't access globalApiKey
```

**Solution**: Access environment variables directly in the Durable Object context.
```typescript
// ✅ This works in Durable Objects
private getEnvironmentApiKey(): string | undefined {
    return (this as any).env?.ZENBOOKER_API_KEY || globalApiKey;
}
```

### 2. McpAgent Framework Requirements
- `McpAgent` requires Durable Object configuration in `wrangler.jsonc`
- Must have `MCP_OBJECT` binding configured
- Removing Durable Object config causes "Could not find McpAgent binding" errors
- Constructor is protected - cannot instantiate directly in tests

### 3. Configuration Dependencies
**wrangler.jsonc** must include:
```jsonc
{
  "migrations": [
    {
      "new_sqlite_classes": ["ZenbookerMCP"],
      "tag": "v1"
    }
  ],
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "class_name": "ZenbookerMCP",
        "name": "MCP_OBJECT"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**After config changes**: Always run `npx wrangler types` to regenerate TypeScript definitions.

### 4. Testing Strategy

#### Local Testing Challenges
- Cloudflare Workers code uses `cloudflare:` protocol imports that don't work in Node.js tests
- Environment variables need to be set differently for tests vs production
- Durable Object isolation makes unit testing complex

#### Best Practices
1. **Test helper functions in isolation**: Copy functions to test files to avoid import issues
2. **Use mocks for external APIs**: Mock `fetch` for API calls
3. **Test business logic separately**: Extract pure functions for easier testing
4. **Integration tests with real env vars**: Set `ZENBOOKER_API_KEY` for actual API testing

### 5. API Key Management
**Secrets vs Environment Variables**:
- Use `wrangler secret put ZENBOOKER_API_KEY` for sensitive values
- Secrets are accessible as `env.ZENBOOKER_API_KEY` in the Worker
- Global variables don't persist across Durable Object boundaries

### 6. Debugging Workflow
1. **Test locally first**: Use test suite before deploying
2. **Use console.log strategically**: Add logging to understand execution flow
3. **Check wrangler logs**: Use `npx wrangler tail` for real-time debugging
4. **Validate TypeScript**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` before deployment
5. **Step-by-step deployment**: Make one change, test, deploy, verify

### 7. API Integration Best Practices
- Always check API documentation for exact field requirements
- Handle API errors gracefully with descriptive messages
- Use proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- Validate inputs before making API calls

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run tests
npm run test:run

# Deploy to Cloudflare
npx wrangler deploy

# View logs
npx wrangler tail

# Manage secrets
npx wrangler secret list
npx wrangler secret put ZENBOOKER_API_KEY

# Regenerate types after config changes
npx wrangler types
```

### Testing with Environment Variables
```bash
# Set env var for testing
export ZENBOOKER_API_KEY="your-api-key"
npm run test:run

# Or inline
ZENBOOKER_API_KEY="your-api-key" npm run test:run
```

## Code Patterns

### Tool Definition Pattern
```typescript
this.server.tool(
    "tool_name",
    {
        param: z.string().describe("Clear description of what this parameter does"),
        optional_param: z.string().optional().describe("Optional parameter description"),
    },
    async (params) => {
        // Use this.getEnvironmentApiKey() for API key access
        const result = await makeZenbookerRequest(endpoint, method, params, this.getEnvironmentApiKey());
        return {
            content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(result, null, 2) }],
        };
    }
);
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```typescript
if (!apiKey) {
    throw new Error("Zenbooker API key is required. Please set the ZENBOOKER_API_KEY environment variable.");
}
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't remove Durable Object config** - McpAgent requires it
2. **Don't rely on global variables in tools** - Use instance methods instead
3. **Don't skip type regeneration** - Always run `wrangler types` after config changes
4. **Don't test in production** - Use local testing and staging environments
5. **Don't forget to handle API errors** - Zenbooker API returns structured error responses

## External API Documentation
- Zenbooker API Reference: https://developers.zenbooker.com/reference/introduction
- Requires authentication to view detailed schemas
- Use live API testing to understand field requirements when docs are incomplete

## File Structure
```
src/
  index.ts              # Main MCP agent implementation
tests/
  *.test.ts            # Test files (avoid cloudflare: imports)
  setup.ts             # Test configuration
  helpers.ts           # Test utilities
  mocks.ts             # API mocks
wrangler.jsonc         # Cloudflare Workers configuration
worker-configuration.d.ts  # Generated types (don't edit manually)
```

## Remember
- **Environment isolation** is the #1 cause of "working locally but not in production" issues
- **Always test the deployment** after making configuration changes
- **Use the test suite** to catch issues before deployment
- **Check logs immediately** after deployment to verify functionality
- **One change at a time** when debugging complex issues
