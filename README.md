## ü§ñ For AI Assistants: READ .cursorrules FIRST

**Before making any changes to this project, always read the [`.cursorrules`](.cursorrules) file.** It contains critical development axioms, architecture lessons learned, and project-specific patterns that must be followed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: API Key Required

This server requires a Zenbooker API key to function. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section below.

## Get started: 

[![Deploy to Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/tree/main/demos/remote-mcp-authless)

This will deploy your MCP server to a URL like: `remote-mcp-server-authless.<your-account>.workers.dev/sse`

Alternatively, you can use the command line below to get the remote MCP Server created on your local machine:
```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-mcp-server --template=cloudflare/ai/demos/remote-mcp-authless
```

## Environment Variables

Before deploying or running locally, you must set your Zenbooker API key:

### For Local Development
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your ZENBOOKER_API_KEY
```

### For Cloudflare Workers Deployment
```bash
wrangler secret put ZENBOOKER_API_KEY
# Enter your Zenbooker API key when prompted
```

### Getting a Zenbooker API Key
1. Log into your Zenbooker admin panel
2. Navigate to Settings > Developers > API  
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated key

## Available Tools

The server provides 13 different tools for interacting with the Zenbooker API:

### Jobs
- `list_jobs` - List jobs with filtering options
- `get_job` - Get specific job details

### Customers  
- `list_customers` - List customers with search/filtering
- `get_customer` - Get specific customer details

For detailed parameter information, see [ZENBOOKER_README.md](./ZENBOOKER_README.md).

## Customizing your MCP Server

To add your own [tools](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/tools/) to the MCP server, define each tool inside the `init()` method of `src/index.ts` using `this.server.tool(...)`. 

## Connect to Cloudflare AI Playground

You can connect to your MCP server from the Cloudflare AI Playground, which is a remote MCP client:

1. Go to https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/
2. Enter your deployed MCP server URL (`remote-mcp-server-authless.<your-account>.workers.dev/sse`)
3. You can now use your MCP tools directly from the playground!

## Connect Claude Desktop to your MCP server

You can also connect to your remote MCP server from local MCP clients, by using the [mcp-remote proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote). 

To connect to your MCP server from Claude Desktop, follow [Anthropic's Quickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) and within Claude Desktop go to Settings > Developer > Edit Config.

Update with this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zenbooker": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:8787/sse"  // or remote-mcp-server-authless.your-account.workers.dev/sse
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude and you should see the Zenbooker tools become available.
